# Using NumPy Arrays

## Problems

These are just some basic array manipulation problems to get you used to working with NumPy arrays.

#### Set 1

1. Create a NumPy array of the integers 1 through 7.
2. Set the first and last elements in the array to zero.
3. Use `.size` to determine the length of the array.
4. Sum all of the integers in the array.
5. Using the results from parts 3 and 4, find the average of the array.

#### Set 2

1. Create a 1D NumPy array of 10,000 elements, all initially set to 0.0.
2. Use a `while` loop and set every 101st element equal to `1.0`. (indices 0, 101, 202, 303, ...).
3. Change the shape of the array to be 100 x 100.
4. Use a `for` loop to set the first element of every row equal to the sum of all the values in that row.
5. Create a new array from the first elements in each of your rows. (HINT: You can make an array from a list.)
6. Take the product of all the elements in your new array.

#### Set 3

1. Use `arange` to create an array of decimals from zero to 26. (HINT: dtype=float)
2. Reshape that array to be a 3 x 3 x 3 multi-dimensional array.
3. Print the first and last element in the array, using three indexes.
4. Using three `for` loops, divide every number by the `sum` of all 3 elements in its row.
5. Calculate the `sum` of all the elements in the array.
6. Create a new array, where every element is the square root of the old one.
7. Calculate the product of all the elements in your new array.

#### Set 4

1. Use `np.ones` to create an array, `a`, which is five elements long.
2. Use `np.arange` to create an array, `b`, which is the integers from 2 to 6 (five elements long).
3. Use `np.arange` to create an array, `c`, which is the even integers 2 to 12. (HINT: With `range`, you could do: range(min, max, step).)
4. Use `np.arange` to creat3 an array, `d`, which is the float values of the integers from 1 to 5.
5. Create a new array: x = c + a - b.
6. What is the value of d - x?
